# Archived Code Samples
This repository is dedicated to keeping all old projects of any value up for viewing from an academic perspective, most of these are old class projects. 

**HeapManager_C**
- Heap Manager was one of two archived memory management related projects. Test cases have been commented, pull and uncomment to show them working. Cases consist of usage of the heap manager by using in a Standard Deviation function to perform calculations on the data in the heap.

**HoneyMustard**
- A code name for a project developed in Unity v5.3.5. Purpose was to learn transferable programming skills to game development and acclimate to the game development environment.

**MPSS**
- Minimum Positive Subsequent Sum (MPSS) was a project to show a practical approach showing the difference in big "O" time complexity through several algorithms that closely corelate to the theoretical times ( O(n), O(n log n), etc..).

**Maximum Subsequent Sum**
- Similar to the above, a different set of time complexities and task being assessed.

**MemoryManager**
- A basic Memory Manager in C++ compiled on a 32-bit Linux kernel. It used dynamic memory allocation to allocate increasingly larger blocks of memory to test system stress, (Tested up to 4Gb).
