# Archived Code Samples
Some code samples in various languages from my time at university

**HeapManager_C**
- Heap Manager that was written in C. Commented out some "quick" test cases putting the heap manager on display (Sample Standard Deviation)

**HoneyMustard**
- Isometric Game/Project proof of concept developed in Unity v5.3.5. Wanted to exhibit transferable programming skills to game development(Map Finding Algorithms/A*, Recursion, etc). I added some thoughts on the experience in a retrospective [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B65_iz9n0h9aUjNXMEh2SVpxOUk)

**MPSS**
- Minimum Positive Subsequent Sum (MPSS). Practical application of Algorithm Analysis with observable results.

**Maximum Subsequent Sum**
- Similar to the above, albeit with a different set of time complexities and task.

**MemoryManager**
- A basic 4GB Limit Memory Manager in Written in C++, compiled on a 32-bit Linux kernel. Very fun project into an interesting topic.

**PhotoPhighter**
- A mobile game developed in Unity 4, in the same spirit as an older Nintendo 3DS title called Photo Dojo. This project was an interesting  prototype, showing off some of the unique games that could be made using and experience gained using a Unity to interface a device's hardware, something I've always been curious about. The folder holds only the .apk file so install it and give it a try, be sure to close this as I'm almost positive its not very "performant" when taking photos.
